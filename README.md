# lodash-lib
In this project, we will be implementing some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library. We will be implementing ten methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

In implementing each method, we will follow these four steps:

**Specify**: the functionality of the method we are implementing
**Ideate**: a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code
**Implement**: our game plan
**Test**: our code to ensure it works as expected

*This project is part of the Codecademy's Web Development path.
